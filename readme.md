# Configuration
You will need:
* Python 2.7

# How to use
First, ensure you have the correct version of python installed. You can download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Second, install the required dependencies:
* `pip install requests`
* `pip install openpyxl`

Now you can run the script. To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Copy `ashrae.py` into the same directory as the excel file you're working with, or copy `ashrae_bulk.py` into a directory with multiple excel files.
2. Run the python script:`python ashrae.py` OR `python ashrae_bulk.py`
3. Open the excel file(s) to view the values.
